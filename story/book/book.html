        <h2 id="chapter1">Chapter 1: The Name of Tweedy</h2>
        <p>
          A quiet, peaceful night was not unusual for the inhabitants of the lesser-known poultry farm belonging to Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy of the southern United States. Perhaps the former Tweedy gained some sort of local acknowledgement for his contributions towards the war efforts a few years earlier; but the war was long forgotten on this side of the country, and even more so its heroes. Though Mr. Tweedy was never particularly agreeable or charming--not even pleasantly reserved, as we tend to think of countrymen, especially farmers--he became less so each day he spent at that farm, for not even the war could mangle him as much as the words that surged from the mouth of his wife.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mrs. Tweedy herself endured a distinct change while her husband was away on German frontiers. Left to run the affairs of the entire farm, she downsized the farm to just the chickens to cut as many of the costs as she could without bringing about ruin. She would have fired Mr. Tweedy when he returned, had they not been married. The ties of matrimony kept the farm alive, for who would buy eggs from a woman when the agricultural business belonged to men?
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed, Mrs. Tweedy did not tolerate women who spent a great deal of time focused on their appearances, for she believed that a great deal of more important business should be had than adhering to the latest patterns of calico and lace ribbon. This was evident in her severe manner of dress: where other women matched oranges to Autumn and yellows to Summer, Mrs. Tweedy wore the deepest black, most plain dresses ever known, for every season (to her credit, she hand-sewed them herself some 20 years ago). Even still, she sympathized with other women, other wives of farmers or pastors or doctors or other highly regarded jobs, in a way she could not with their husbands. To be born a woman was similar to being left-handed in a world dominated by right-handed folks; everything in life was made for the right-handed people, and the right-handed people were always at an advantage for occupations. This, of course, is an oversimplification of the complexities surrounding gender at the time. However, we view their lens and scope of experience through our own lens, polished by time.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the many good and bad qualities of Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy, in all of their human strengths and foibles, the very thing they lacked for each other was affection, which would never be afforded to any other creature. And so the chickens are introduced.
        </p>
        <hr class="long">
        <h2 id="chapter2">Chapter 2: Gingerly</h2>
        <p>
          The night continued quietly with barely an inhalation of breath, but the chickens in the neatly lined coops half a mile away from the looming farmer’s house were restless. Ginger was gone, of course. Ginger was always gone this late at night, around midnight. Although, she had never gone out before consulting someone, namely Mac, about her leaving. Perhaps she did consult Mac, for Mac lay on her top-bunk, resolutely silent, without waiting at the door of the coop like the other chickens. The other chickens did not take much notice of this, however, because Mac was atypically loquacious. What the chickens could not quite consider, though they unconsciously understood, was that Mac was usually out with Ginger. This is what made the chickens so uneasy, though they did not have the wits to understand what they knew.
        </p>
        <p>
          As it turned out, Mac knew exactly of Ginger’s plans for this evening, having built the decoy Ginger would need in just a few moments. Every few seconds, Mac checked a small watch dangling on a neck-piece below her shawl. At the stroke of midnight, she was instructed to instruct Edwina, the head of their coop, to organize all of the chickens into a straight line outside, under the shadow of the large fence encasing all the coops. Afterwards, she was to place the decoy, a music contraption designed as a garden gnome, on the opposite side of where Ginger would be found.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the hands on the clock slowly ticked its last few seconds before the start of a new day, Mac carefully withdrew from the bed and headed toward Edwina, who was the closest to the door.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the clock struck midnight, Ginger was not quite ready for the plan to unfold. The night waited in anticipation of the chickens’ escape, and in its excitement, did nothing to mask the clamor of a shovel hitting the ground near a raised part of the fence. Ginger’s work of nearly a half-hour, a dreadful amount of time for a chicken with no arm muscles, was several times interrupted by the keen ears of Mr. Tweedy’s guard dogs, along with Mr. Tweedy himself. The watchmen had already turned in Ginger’s direction a few times, and she dreaded to think of how disastrous this particular plan might turn out. Not a single chicken had lost their lives in the days since Ginger first began planning and executing their journeys to freedom, and Ginger hoped that day would never come.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trustworthy and intuitive as always, Edwina knew what Mac wanted before Mac had wrestled herself to the door of the coop. The plan was roughly the same every night: line up quietly behind the fence while Ginger creates the escape route. For some reason, Edwina felt this night would be the most important of her life, and she must act the leader she was accordingly. Edwina cleared her throat just as Mac leaned into her ear.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Chickens, it is time to get into position,” she spoke softly, but firmly, “tonight is our night.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Edwina watched from the corner of her eye as Mac quietly left from the front door, having completed her first task.
        </p>
        <p>
          “We will line up at the south side of the fence, the farthest away from the human’s house.” She began to usher the chickens out of the coop and moved throughout until she reached the last coop, all the while giving her small, rehearsed, pep talk.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the chickens were in position, a few joined Edwina’s speech along the way, having heard it several times before. Nonetheless, Edwina finished with, “...are just as much a species as humans, and we have our own rights, too. It is time we fight for our freedom!”
        </p>
        <p>
          Then came more silence. Edwina slowly passed her gaze across the chickens, due to the fact that it was customary for a few to applaud, or whoop at the very least, but they were staring silently behind her. Edwina turned around and noticed, for the first time, that Mr. Tweedy was at the opposite end of the fence. He was not faced in their direction, but the proximity between them did make Edwina shiver a little.
        </p>
        <p>
          As if in slow motion, Edwina knew that the plan would not be carried out today. Edwina kept her eyes on Mr. Tweedy despite the commotion behind her (Ginger, having freed herself from the fence, was helping others do the same). Mac struggled, not a quarter of a mile between them, with a funny looking garden gnome. If only Edwina could warn Mac to stop what she was doing, because the chickens were already escaping without that part of the plan. But it was too late. By the time half the chickens were on the opposite side of the fence, a strange, distorted noise sounded from the little gnome alerting Mr. Tweedy and the dogs of the chickens.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without thinking, Edwina rushed forward to grab for Mac. Neither chicken was a great runner, but Edwina was the better of the two. Edwina met Mac halfway and grabbed her under the wing just as Mr. Tweedy scrambled over the other side of the fence. She made eye contact with Mr. Tweedy for the briefest, most uncomfortable second, and then the pair of chickens bolted towards their exit. Nearly all of the chickens were standing on the other side of the fence, and until Edwina was much closer, she did not understand why they were not running for their lives. Surrounding both sides of the chickens were Mr. Tweedy’s guard dogs, growling viciously at the chickens. They were cornered.
        </p>
        <hr class="long">
        <h2 id="chapter3">Chapter 3: Egg-sit or Egg-xit</h2>
        <p>
          <i>"Edwina was taken."</i> The whispers spread faster than chicken pox ever could.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"She didn’t produce any eggs last week. She fought directly with Mr. Tweedy, and wounded him deeply, but could not escape him.</i> Ginger knew that she had to put an end to all of the rumors, but she could not confront them because they held, well, most of them at least, some truth. Even worse, Ginger could not help but feel a deep pang of guilt about Edwina. Had Ginger started to dig a little earlier, a little faster, or if she pushed out the chickens more quickly and given them directions on where to run next, then perhaps Edwina would still be with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was the subsequent midnight now, but there would be no attempt at escaping today, as Edwina’s experience was a warning that instilled fear in their plans. The memories of the day before pulsed through Ginger’s mind like a recurring nightmare. The dogs had cornered the chickens, and Mr. Tweedy was there at the fence with the angriest look on his face. In a desperate attempt at distraction, Ginger ran towards the farmer’s house, and the guard dogs chased after her. Mr. Tweedy had thrown open the gate, swept all the chickens with one stroke of his leg back inside the fenced area, then gone after Ginger. She hid behind a flower pot on the steps of Mr. Tweedy’s house, but one of the dogs had thrust it aside. At the time, Ginger felt that it was going to be the last moment of her life.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the sound of a broken pot, the hard clay clashing against the cement floor, had awoken a very annoyed Mrs. Tweedy. She swung open the door with enough force to shake the entire foundation of the building, and glared down before her. The dogs whimpered before her, and Mr. Tweedy lowered his head. Mrs. Tweedy took one look at Ginger, and screeched at Mr. Tweedy, “You WORTHLESS piece of gum on a boot heel! First you RUINED my batch of cornbread by passing me sugar, not salt, then you--” and the list of Mr. Tweedy’s latest mishaps went on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ginger was not understanding a word, until Mr. Tweedy was ordered to deal with the rogue chicken before Mrs. Tweedy’s beauty sleep was further delayed. Mr. Tweedy had waited for a second after Mrs. Tweedy slammed the door in his face before snatching Ginger by the throat and throwing her into the garbage can until morning as punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though, the worst punishment of the entire day was not sleeping amongst the garbage, but of Mrs. Tweedy’s personal presence of the day’s chicken and egg count. Ginger had been released before then to stand among the ranks of chickens. Mrs. Tweedy had meticulously counted the chickens, twice, before moving on to count the eggs they had borne. She examined Edwina with keen interest before sadistically smiling and commanding Mr. Tweedy to take Edwina inside the house for slaughter. Ginger did not know why Edwina was being taken into the house. After the humans had left, Ginger had climbed to the top of the coop to watch the happenings within the farmer’s house. She wished she had not done so.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same scene continued to flash through her mind. Ginger ran outside of the coop and wretched up vomit from her mouth and tears from her eyes. No, she must remember Edwina as the strong chicken who had her wits about her. Edwina was reliable and responsible. Edwina, herself, had spent a few separate nights within the garbage can. Ginger looked up to the sky and imagined that Edwina was there amongst the stars, away from the bars of a fence and the chains of injustice. A shooting star passed before Ginger’s very eyes, along with something else.
        </p>
        <p>
          That something else was very much <i>not</i> a shooting star, but a wailing whirl of brown and yellow colors that were coming in fast towards Ginger. The mass of color bludgeoned into Ginger and she was flung, along with the mass, into a conveniently placed heap of hay. The hay also conveniently masked her voice. Although she was not a fowl, she did have a few nasty things to say to whatever it was that knocked her down.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mass of brown and yellow took a different form as it helped Ginger out from the hay and into the moonlight. <i>I’m glad it's living then, thought Ginger, so I can--</i>but she never quite finished her thought as she took in the specimen before her.
        </p>
        <p>
          His feathers were a soft mocha that deeply contrasted a pair of bright auburn eyes. Ginger had never seen another rooster on the farm besides her good and wisened friend Fowler. Where Fowler was droopy and gray, this rooster was bright, strong and lively. She took in his strong arms and striking demeanor. It took a moment for common sense to settle in before she realized that the rooster had begun to pose and flex for her.
        </p>
        <p>
          “You should close your mouth, honey, before the flies make themselves at home,” the rooster said with a wink.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suddenly repulsed, Ginger furiously said, “by the state of your breath, they’ve already found one,” she swelled, “and the name is Ginger.”
        </p>
        <p>
          She grabbed him by the patriotic bandana hanging around his neck, and nearly dragged him to Fowler’s quarters, because Fowler would know just what to do. Before they made three steps, the noise of a blaring engine sounded. This time, the mysterious rooster dragged Ginger behind a coop, out of sight from noise.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Let go of me!” Ginger started, but was instantly shushed. The rooster peered quietly from the coop to survey the general direction of the noise.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>“Who are you?”</i> Ginger asked, slightly intimidated by the noise, which seemed to be drawing nearer.
        </p>
        <p>
          “The name’s Rocky, Rocky Rhodes,” the rooster said. Without so much as a glance away from the engine noise, Rocky produced a torn piece of paper and passed it to Ginger. ROCKY THE FLYING ROOSTER. Ginger could almost hug Rocky. This was it, this was their answer: Rocky would teach them how to fly.
        </p>
        <hr class="long">
        <h2 id="chapter4">Chapter 4: In Memory of Edwina</h2>
        <p>
          “Absolutely not,” Rocky said.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I agree, absolutely not,” said Fowler.
        </p>
        <p>
          “But why not?” asked Ginger, “Rocky can teach us how to fly, and in return, we will hide him from that human who wants him back.”
        </p>
        <p>
          That very human who wanted Rocky back was just outside speaking with Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy. He was a skinny man from a traveling circus. Rocky had pulled Ginger inside Fowler’s coop before she could get a better look at the Circus Man.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I will not sacrifice the privacy of my quarters for a circus animal. I am a rooster of dignity. I was part of the Air Force at war, and I am endowed with great honors that a circus animal will never aspire to,” Fowler said.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I agree,” said Rocky, “All I want is freedom from the Circus, and I <i>will</i> never aspire to join some force that is in the air.”
        </p>
        <p>
          But Ginger could not take no for an answer. For years she had dreamed of the free parts of the countryside. A home for all the chickens, which she had come to love as her family. A small piece of grass to lay on. A lake of pure clean water, and worms in abundance for food. This image lulled her to sleep each night after each unsuccessful escape. It kept her going to meet the weekly egg quota. It gave her patience to give her daily explanation to the chickens as to why they needed to leave. If Rocky wanted freedom, why couldn’t she?
        </p>
        <p>
          “Fine,” she said nonchalantly, then pushed Rocky outside. Fowler looked amused, and Rocky a little baffled, then cheery.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he turned away, Ginger did something she never thought she could do — screech. Usually it was Fowler to make such an awful noise in the morning to start off the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rocky rushed to cover her mouth, but the work was done. The Circus Man and the Tweedies’ attention was fixated on the chicken coops. Rocky rushed Ginger back inside Fowler’s coop just as the Circus Man and Mr. Tweedy approached the coops.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Fine, I will help you,” gasped Rocky.
        </p>
        <p>
          “That’s very well, but I won’t,” countered Fowler.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Fowler, please, just for a few nights!” Ginger hurried, “Rocky will teach us to fly, and then we can live in the country. Remember Edwina? Edwina would always compliment your shiny Air Force badge, and look at what the humans did to her. The humans do not have compassion — not anymore. They care for you when they need you, but they dispose of you when they don’t. <i>None</i> of us are disposable, Fowler, and you know that.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Ginger was aware of the approaching footsteps, and so were the roosters.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Edwina is... Edwina would want this,” consented Fowler.
        </p>
        <hr class="long">
        <h2 id="chapter5">Chapter 5: Fight for your Right</h2>
        <p>
          “We need to train hard and keep our mindset firm,” Rocky started.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a bright morning, and the chickens had just woken up. Ginger explained to them the situation, and the chickens readily agreed when they caught sight of Rocky.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ginger interpreted this as nervousness, but was unaware that it could have meant anything else. “Anyone who does not adhere to training will report directly to me for strict discipline.”
        </p>
        <p>
          As Rocky rallied the chickens and instructed them to do various exercises, Ginger tended to a different affair with a different species entirely. “Nick!” she called out into a hole in one of the coops, the temporary stay of the species, “Fletcher!”
        </p>
        <p>
          A pair of large rats crawled out of the hole and stretched out leisurely before her. “At your service miss,” the gray rat, Nick, yawned, “for payment, of course.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Nick was adorned with a variety of Ginger’s previous forms of payment: a stray piece of canvas material (which was formerly a piece on a pair of Mr. Tweedy’s patched up pants, but had fallen off) covered Nick as a fashionable vest; a few chicken feathers were weaved as a belt; and under the belt was an odd assortment of other gadgets, though some of these were likely stolen by Nick himself and not given to him by Ginger.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I need you to gather me a few more screws and a piece of paper for Mac,” said Ginger, “She has an idea for a new machine that could finally free us from this place.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “When will ya realize these ideas never gon’ work, Miss Ginger,” said Fletcher, the other rat with darker brown fur, “I am all for helping ya escape and what not, but is probly never happenin’.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Thank you, Fletcher, for your words of encouragement,” she said, then addressed Nick, “how much is it gonna be this time?”
        </p>
        <p>
          “A whole piece of paper is quite costly, miss,” Nick drawled out, “I want an egg.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Are we bargaining for eggs over here,” a voice said.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rocky drew near to Ginger and the rats. “Honey, why aren’t you training with the other chickens now? I thought <i>you</i> were the one who wanted to learn how to fly!”
        </p>
        <p>
          Ginger blushed, then said, “I am considering all my options at the moment.”
        </p>
        <p>
          She turned to Nick and Fletcher, “An egg is too expensive. You can have as much chicken feed as you can eat every day for a week, but I will not give you an egg.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Nick and Fletcher considered the trade for a moment, and Rocky looked on in amusement.
        </p>
        <p>
          “It’s a deal,” agreed Nick, then the pair of them were gone.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Quite the company,” said Rocky, “Now will you join me, doll, with the other chickens?” he asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          “My name is <i>Ginger!</i>”
        </p>
        <hr class="short">
        <p>
          The chickens spent the entire day jumping and twirling and building up their muscles, but they hadn’t made much progress as a whole. Not one chicken had grasped the ability to fly. Rocky kept assuring the chickens that flying was a process, and it took time; but Ginger was growing more skeptical as the hours of training passed on.
        </p>
        <p>
          At one point, a few hours into training, she caught a few chickens giving Rocky a back massage, to which he responded: “Well, I did say that those who did not train would report to me for discipline.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Ginger ignored Rocky for the rest of the day, though this was a hard feat for her. She tried to focus on the countryside while doing her training, but Rocky’s face kept interrupting her daydreams. When she would peer into the clear waters of the country, his face would stare back at her. As she lay down on a soft bit of grass, she could see his outline in the clouds. Ginger intensified her movements as a result, but it was of no use.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sound of another engine broke her train of thought, and Ginger instantly found Rocky’s eyes from a distance. She made her way towards him and they quickly filed into Fowler’s coop.
        </p>
        <p>
          “The Circus Man doesn’t give up,” Rocky said with a slight edge in his voice. Ginger wanted to say something to comfort him, but she was still a little upset from the day’s earlier episode, so she stayed silent. As the two chickens peeped as best they could through a crack in Fowler’s coop, they saw that it was not the Circus Man at all, but a different man delivering large crates of loud, clanky metal, instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          “This can’t be good,” muttered Ginger.
        </p>

        <p>
          “It’s all in your head. It’s all in your head,” grunted Mr. Tweedy under his breath.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was unpacking the parts of the new machine Mrs. Tweedy had ordered without consulting him. Mrs. Tweedy’s ordering, incidentally, did not end there and she insisted he build it all on his own. Mr. Tweedy minded insomuch that he did not want to be bossed around; however, he contented himself with the work because it distracted him from those chickens. Those <i>organized</i> chickens.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Tweedy had various jobs to do around the farm, but he routinely checked on the chickens to make sure that they were locked up. Out of the corner of his eye, he was certain the chickens were performing the same movements in a synchronized fashion, but when he turned to watch them directly, they were acting like normal chickens. He couldn’t shake the thought from his head. Mr. Tweedy voiced his concerns to his wife, who shot him down immediately and told him that it was all in his head. He knew that she was right: a sane man would not believe a chicken, an inferior species to human beings, would have the capacity to organize. This logic, however, did not help his mind processing, for if the organized chickens were simply a hallucination, then maybe he wasn’t as sane as previously thought, and this only complicated the matter more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Tweedy drudged through the rest of the day, up until the middle of the night, without thinking a single miserable thought of the chickens, his wife, his life, or the chickens. He wished the machine was more difficult to build so he could spend a longer time with it. The machine wouldn’t judge him or his faults; it would not yell at him for simple mistakes. But all too soon, it came time to inform his wife that the machine was done.
        </p>
        <p>
          This machine was the very thing that could redeem the farm. Mrs. Tweedy spent many days fantasizing about the machine and about the life that she could live once it was in business. <i>Mrs. Tweedy’s Homemade Chicken Pies</i> would be an overnight success, she was sure of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Mr. Tweedy, double the food rations for the chickens. I don’t want a single chicken under 5 pounds.”
        </p>
        <hr class="short">
        <p>
          “Stop, stop. STOP,” yelled Ginger as soon as Mr. Tweedy was out of earshot. “Stop eating!”
        </p>
        <p>
          But the chickens were not having it. Mr. Tweedy had come in a few minutes ago with gallons of chicken feed, much more than they were used to, to feed the chickens. Ginger herself had gobbled through her usual amount before she realized Mr. Tweedy was refilling the feed as the chickens were eating. Ginger did not want to think the worst of the situation, but she knew that the chickens would not listen to her otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Mr. Tweedy left, she yelled, “Everyone LISTEN,” this got the attention of a few chickens, but it was the rest of her speech that gained the attention of the others: “The humans are fattening us up! Don’t you see? They are going to <i>kill</i> us! Why else would they bother giving us more food if they just wanted our eggs? Each year they expect more and more eggs from us, but we still cannot fulfill their expectations. And now? They never cared about our eggs. They never cared about <i>us.</i> Our lives were always about what value we could offer them. And right now we are more valuable to them dead than alive.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The chickens remained silent. Ginger wondered if she said things too harshly, but these thoughts went away when she remembered Edwina. She would not let the fate of her friend become the fate of the rest of these chickens.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ginger disappeared to a more secluded area of the chicken farm. She needed space to think about a new escape plan. Unfortunately, a certain rooster would not let that happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Hey sweetheart,” the infuriating rooster said.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Quite the speech you gave out there,” he continued, “a little enlightening, but definitely discouraging.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Rocky tried to come off as lighthearted as possible, but Ginger was not having it. “Look, if you are coming to scold me, I have more important business to do. I’m planning our next escape as you are clearly incapable of teaching a group of chickens how to fly,” Ginger remarked rather irritated.
        </p>
        <p>
          “You see, that’s the problem,” Rocky said, brushing off Ginger’s last comment.
        </p>
        <p>
          “If you want to motivate the chickens to escape, then you need to show them that they are capable of escaping. Constantly telling them that they are victims in this situation will only make them feel and act like victims. We need to empower them. They are stronger than what humans think of them. If you alone are able to come up with nearly successful schemes for freedom, then imagine what everyone could come up with if we worked together.” He told her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ginger felt like disagreeing, but she had to admit that Rocky had a point. The chickens had to be addressed as powerful individuals, the same way Ginger complimented Mac’s smarts and Edwina’s leadership. Ginger needed to find the strengths of each chicken and highlight those abilities. She was just about to thank Rocky until she noticed that he had left.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed, the chickens became depressed as the day progressed into night. They had stopped eating, fortunately, but they had also, unfortunately, stopped doing much of anything else. Ginger’s speech had quite the opposite effect of its intent: the chickens would willingly subject themselves to death because they had no hope of an alternative life.
        </p>
        <hr class="long">
        <h2 id="chapter7">Chapter 7: Chick or Treat</h2>
        <p>
          “Ladies and gentle-rooster, welcome to the most epic chicken dance of the century. Let the dancing BEGIN,” yelled Rocky as the chickens got into formation and started dancing.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the promise from Rocky of a very special egg brewing within him, Nick and Fletcher had gone all out on the night’s venue. Brilliantly colored lights of red, yellow and green lined the edges of walls that touched the ceiling of the chicken coop. In the middle of the ceiling hung a silvery, reflective disco ball that made the light in the coop bounce from place to place. Fletcher was operating a drink bar serving apple juice and water from a few bottles the rats had managed to snatch on another farm. Nick was serving as a DJ by working with a small radio for the occasion.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a few minutes, Rocky noted how successful the event was. Every chicken had shown up to the dance. However, he could not help but notice a certain chicken missing from the party’s attendees. He felt remorse for speaking to Ginger in such a blunt way, and he wanted to apologize to her and make amends before he continued with his own plans. In a way, he would be in Ginger’s position if he were less selfish. Instead, he left the other circus animals to fend for themselves while he escaped. Ginger, on the other hand, truly cared for the chickens that danced before him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rocky sat towards the back of the party, suddenly taken with a bit of sorrow, and observed the party without joining in. Suddenly, a light feather tapped his shoulder, and Ginger was once again before him.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I wanted to apologize,” they both started to say, “no, you go first!”
        </p>
        <p>
          “You go first,” said Rocky with a slight smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I wanted to apologize... I realize that learning to fly will take time, and that is not your fault,” said Ginger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rocky felt guilty, very guilty. He held a secret that, at this point, he could never tell Ginger without breaking her heart; more importantly, he did not want to break her heart. So, instead, he apologized for what he could, without giving his plans away. “I’m sorry I spoke to you in such a manner. Even though I don’t know airforce etiquette like good ol’ Fowler, I was not raised to be a pig, but a well-mannered chicken.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Have you ever met a pig before?” laughed Ginger, “because I have, and they are quite clean if they are under a nice bit of shade.”
        </p>
        <p>
          For a brief moment, things were alright between the two of them. Rocky offered his wing to Ginger and led her to the dance floor.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Well, I admit that I have never met a pig before. Were the pigs you knew at least courteous, though?” Rocky asked, his previous sadness now gone with the presence of Ginger masking it.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Oh no, not at all. The pigs I knew were quite pretentious, really,” Ginger replied.
        </p>
        <p>
          The night continued until the chickens were worn from dancing. Rocky needed to tell her, now that he was a little buzzed from the apple juice. He had to let Ginger know. “Listen, uh, there’s something I gotta tell you,” he started, but he never got to finish, as the lights suddenly went out and the disco ball rattled.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nick turned off the radio, and the chickens went silent. Led by Ginger, the chickens filed outside to investigate the strange power outage. Mr. Tweedy was speaking with Mrs. Tweedy; Ginger wished she could understand the language of the humans, then she would know why Mrs. Tweedy looked so happy, and why Mr. Tweedy was walking toward them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Tweedy opened the gate of the chicken enclosure, and out of nowhere, grabbed Ginger by the neck forcefully. “I’ve got a score to settle with you,” he muttered, “all those years you made a fool of me. Well I know, I know you been organizing them chickens. Well, you won’t get that chance no more.” He walked Ginger over to his wife, who was standing by the pie machine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Tweedy had never seen his wife this happy; he figured he must be doing something right. “They’ve got Ginger!” yelled Babs to the chickens.
        </p>
        <p>
          “We mustn’t panic, we mustn’t panic!” Babs shouted as he tried to calm the chickens, but they were in utter chaos.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Bloomin' heck! They've got Ginger!” Babs yelled frantically.
        </p>
        <p>
          “What’s going on? What is it?” asked Rocky, just leaving from the coop where the dance was held.
        </p>
        <p>
          “They got Ginger, Mr. Rhodes. They’re taking her to the chop!” Babs nearly screamed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though she never saw the point of Ginger’s escape plans, she loved Ginger dearly.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Well, what are you waiting for, laddie? Fly over there and save her!” commanded Fowler to Rocky.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chickens suddenly stopped screaming, all watching Rocky expectantly.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Of, of course...” said Rocky, internally panicking, thinking quickly, he continued, “No! No..that is just what they would expect. I say we give them the element of surprise!”
        </p>
        <p>
          As the chickens murmured in agreement, Rocky spotted a hanger up near a zipline leading past the humans farm. “Babs! Give me a boost to that black contraption just there!”
        </p>
        <p>
          The chickens gathered around him to boost him up, and suddenly he was zipping down the zipline, where he landed on top of Mrs. Tweedy’s pie machine. Mr. Tweedy locked Ginger upside down in the machine. “Chickens go in, pies come out,” he hummed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mrs. Tweedy, approving of his enthusiastic behavior, returned to their home. “Chicken pies, not apple pies. Chicken, chicken, chicken pies!” he continued to hum.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that Ginger had been secured, Mr. Tweedy left to find the pie machine manual one more time.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Yo! Doll!” whisper-screamed Rocky.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rocky!” Ginger gasped, gratefully.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I’m coming!” he said back.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rocky jumped down from the pie machine onto a long treadmill that transported the pies into boxes. Before he could reach her, the lock holding Ginger released her, and dropped her into the next segment of the machine.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Rocky!” yelled Ginger as she slid into the machine, pulling a lever on the way down.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I’ll be there before you can say mixed vegetables!” said Rocky.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lever Ginger had pulled stopped the treadmill, so Rocky ran to the shoot Ginger had fallen into. Rocky leaned into the shoot until he could find Ginger among slices of carrots and a few other vegetables, then he jumped in.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I’m stuck!” yelled Ginger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rocky reached her just in time to free her from the trap of a stubborn green bean. He was not quick enough to save them, however, from falling into the meat section of the machine. The birds ran through this part of the machine, dodging swinging saws and flattening hammers. They made it past the meat section, only to be met with a large dough roller. They both scream.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Hold on!” Rocky yelled.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ginger quickly latched onto him as he grabbed a chain and swung away from the roller to the next opening of the machine. The two chickens fall into a dough covered pan, where vegetable sludge falls on top of them. “Yuck!” Rocky said in disgust.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before more sludge could cover them, Rocky stuffed the vegetable distributor with a fairly large carrot chunk, causing the machine to sputter and vibrate. “Yes!”
        </p>
        <p>
          Rocky and Ginger high five, then turn to the next enemy: the oven. “Come on!” yells Ginger.
        </p>
        <p>
          She grabbed Rocky’s arm and pulled him through a closing door toward the outside of the machine. Rocky falls back onto the pie just as Ginger makes it to the door. Thinking quickly, Ginger pulls a wrench from the outside of the machine, and wedges it in the machine to stop the door from closing. She reaches back and grabs Rocky and suddenly, they are outside of the machine, safe from its immediate dangers.
        </p>
        <p>
          They sit for a second to catch their breath, and notice how the machine is rumbling oddly. “I think we should...” started Ginger.
        </p>
        <p>
          “RUN!” finished Rocky.
        </p>
        <hr class="short">
        <p>
          Mrs. Tweedy heard an awful noise emanating from the pie machine a floor below her. She was sure this noise was not included in the description of the machine when she first bought it. She hurriedly put on her outside robe, taking long strides down the stairs and towards her beloved machine. As she drew closer, the alarm from the machine grew louder and louder.
        </p>
        <p>
          “What did you do, you great pudding?” she scowled at her husband.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I didn’t do anything!” Mr. Tweedy defended himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The machine vibrated before him. Suddenly, vegetables of every kind began to spew out along with a thick brown gravy. The gravy coated both the couple and the gears of the machine.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Turn it off!” yelled Mrs. Tweedy.
        </p>
        <p>
          “It won’t turn off!” Mr. Tweedy yelled back.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pair ran from the machine before it consumed them. Pieces of the food and machine flew in all directions and made a ginormous mess before Mrs. Tweedy had the idea of unplugging the machine.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Look, I fixed it!” said Mr. Tweedy, genuinely, to the displeased face of his wife.
        </p>
        <hr class="long">
        <h2 id="chapter8">Chapter 8: Winging It</h2>
        <p>
          “Chicken pies?” exclaimed a fearful Bunty.
        </p>
        <p>
          “We’re alright for the time being!” said Ginger quickly, “Rocky sabotaged the machine and bought us just a little more time. And he is going to teach us how to fly tomorrow!”
        </p>
        <p>
          The chickens cheered and spoke excitedly amongst themselves as they returned to their coops. Rocky did not feel as excited. He roamed into Fowler’s room shortly after Ginger began to explain the machine to the chickens. He still had a lot to say to Ginger, but he couldn’t find the right words to use. He heard a throat clear behind him.
        </p>
        <p>
          “In light of your action this evening,” began Fowler, “I..I dutifully admit that I have misjudged your character. I therefore present to you this medal of bravery.” Fowler fit his very own Air Force pin on Rocky’s bandana.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I salute you, and I await tomorrow’s flying demonstration with great anticipation.” Fowler left the chicken coop to give Rocky some earned privacy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rocky only felt claustrophobic with his crowded thoughts and ugly wishes. He left the room, too, in search of some fresh air. Rocky climbed to the top of a more secluded coop, home to nobody, where he contemplated his next moves. <i>I’m a fraud,</i> he thought. <i>No matter what I do, I’m going to let these chickens down.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          “Oh, I’m sorry! Were you...” Ginger said, interrupting Rocky’s thoughts. She, herself, was distracted with similar disparaging thoughts of letting the chickens down if her plans did not work for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Sorry, is this your...I’ll get down, I was just,” said Rocky.
        </p>
        <p>
          “No, no, it’s just. No, I’m glad you’re here, and thank you for earlier. For..saving my life!” Ginger told him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rocky couldn’t find the words to respond. Ginger continued, “You know, I come up here every night and look out to that hill over there. I can just imagine what it must be like on the other side. It’s funny, but I’ve—I’ve never actually felt grass beneath my feet. I—I’m... I’m sorry. Here I am rambling on about hills and grass, you had something to say earlier?”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Well, y-yeah. Um, I’ve experienced life out there, as you know. Free ranging and stuff. It’s really not as cracked up as it sounds, you know. The grass is always greener on the other side,” stammered Rocky, then stopped short at the sight of Ginger’s distraught face. “What I’m trying to say is, you’re welcome.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Well, okay then, good night, Rocky,” said Ginger before she walked away from Rocky, even more confused than before they had their conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Goodbye, Ginger,” he whispered into the cold air.
        </p>
        <hr class="short">
        <p>
          “Well, today is <i>the</i> day, girls. We are going to <i>fly,</i>” said Ginger, singing the last word.
        </p>
        <p>
          “We all better start warming up! Everyone get into a neat formation, and I will go get our professional flyer ready!” Ginger skipped towards Fowler’s coop where Rocky was staying.
        </p>
        <p>
          She knocked a few times, then a few more times, but she didn’t get a response. “Rocky, Rocky?” she called out, opening the coop door and peering inside. She walked further into the room realizing something was wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Fowler’s straw bed was the Air Force badge, and beneath that was a piece of torn poster, the other piece to the one Rocky originally gave her nights ago. She carefully unfolded the poster, which read, “In Town For One Week Only,” she gasped in horror as she saw the accompanying picture. Ginger slowly walked out of Fowler’s coop to where the other chickens were. She combined both pieces of the poster until she could see the full image. It was Rocky, alright, but he wasn’t flying. His circus act was being thrust from a large, round cannon. He couldn’t fly.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I knew he was a fake all along. In fact, I’m not sure he was actually American, but a spy for another country!” gossiped Bunty.
        </p>
        <p>
          “So <i>that’s</i> how he could fly. I was wondering, because from the perspective of physics, it is a little impossible for a chicken to fly,” Mac contributed, helpfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          “So what’s the next plan, hun?” asked Babs to Ginger.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Well, it seems the only way out of here is wrapped in pastry,” said Ginger. The chickens gasped around her, for never had they heard Ginger speak in such a pessimistic manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chickens chattered amongst themselves until it began to transform into an entire brawl. “Everyone, shut up!” yelled Ginger, as she carefully examined Fowler’s shiny medal for the first time. The chickens stopped squabbling, and Ginger cleared her throat.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Fowler. What exactly is the RAF?” she said, reading the letters on the medal.
        </p>
        <p>
          “What do you mean, ‘what is it?’ The Royal Air Force is what!” exclaimed Fowler. “Why, when I was in the air force, we flew in a wonderful old crate the size of ten chicken coops!”
        </p>
        <p>
          “You could fly?” asked Ginger, a hint of hope creeping into her voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Why, of course I could fly!” said Fowler, “the flying machine was wonderfully built and could lift you hundreds of feet into the air.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Yes!” said Ginger, “Yes, of course! We could pull this off. We really are going to fly out of here!”
        </p>
        <p>
          The chickens looked at her confusedly. “We’re going to make a crate! Mac, you will handle engineering. Babs, manufacturing. Fowler will be chief aviation advisor,” Ginger continued giving each chicken a job according to their best strengths.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Bunty, you are the most important part of this mission, you are in charge of eggs.” Ginger ordered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nick could not believe his ears, “Eggs?” he asked one more time.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Eggs,” replied Ginger patiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Right, just like the ones that rooster was gonna lay. Only, roosters don’t lay eggs, do they?” he asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Right,” replied Ginger, “One egg for every item on the list. First payment in advance.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Ginger handed Nick an egg, and the two rats scurried with it to gather the items on the list. The chickens were not only racing against the daylight hours, but they were also racing against Mr. Tweedy, who was busy fixing the pie machine. All of the chickens were aware of this, and Ginger more than the others.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Go, go, go!” Ginger encouraged the chickens. “Mac, we need those calculations quickly. Agnes, that has to be really secure. Careful up there Fowler! Bunty, give me a hand, and Babs, keep it up!”
        </p>
        <p>
          The chickens continued until the late afternoon when Ginger heard the forsaken noise of a key inserted into a machine. The pie machine was fixed.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Ginger, what’s the plan?” asked Mac, staring from the incomplete flying machine to the fixed pie machine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chickens looked up at Ginger in anticipation, and Mr. Tweedy started to approach the chickens at this point. Ginger knew there was just one option left.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Attack!” yelled Ginger.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a whirl of feathers and sharp beaks, each chicken sped into Mr. Tweedy. “Mrs. Tweedy!” Mr. Tweedy called out, “Mrs. Tweedy! The chickens are revolting!”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Finally, something we agree on,” muttered Mrs. Tweedy, but she paid no heed to his call.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Help! Mrs...” but Bunty had stuffed a hat into his mouth, and the chickens had successfully tied him up with some rope brought by Nick and Fletcher.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Come on! This is it everyone. We’re escaping!” yelled Ginger.
        </p>
        <p>
          “But, Ginger. The flying machine isn’t ready yet,” quietly interjected Mac.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Listen, we’ll either die free chickens or die trying,” replied Ginger. “Mac, you and Bunty handle the last preparations for the machine, and I will get Fowler to fly the machine! Everyone, SCRAMBLE!”
        </p>
        <p>
          The chickens all got into position as Ginger ran to Fowler. They began to put the plane together, attaching the wings. Nick and Fletcher were on the runway, plugging in lights and waving around tennis rackets to direct the chickens.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Alright, Fowler, ready for takeoff,” said Ginger.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Behind you all the way,” replied Fowler.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ginger looked at him, confused. “But you’re supposed to be up there, as the pilot..” said Ginger.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Oh, don’t be ridiculous, I can’t fly this contraption,” said Fowler, and continued at Ginger’s dumbfounded expression, “Back in my day in the air force, I was a part of the poultry division. We were mascots.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “You mean..you never actually flew a plane?” asked Ginger, terrified of his answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Good heavens, no. I’m a chicken!” chuckled Fowler.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ginger contemplated for a second, telling him, “Fowler, you have to fly it. You have the most experience out of all of us. You’re always talking about back in your day. Well, today is your day.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Fowler absentmindedly grabbed his Air Force medal, “Wing Commander T.I. Fowler, reporting for duty.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The chickens cheered in support. “Well, come on. What are you all waiting for? We have a flight to catch!”
        </p>
        <p>
          Ginger looked to Mac for confirmation before commanding the chickens herself. “Everyone to the pedals! Fowler, now!”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Roger! Contact!” yelled Fowler. Suddenly, each chicken began to pedal the wheels they built on the machine. The wheels powered the engine to make the plane fly.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Cleared for takeoff!” Fowler continued.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chickens towards the back of the machine raised its back ramp, effectively closing the plane for takeoff. “Full throttle!” yelled Fowler.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mac quickly pulled a lever to add another gear to make the plane go faster. The plane temporarily lifted itself a few feet from the ground before slowing down and dropping again. “We need more power!” yelled Fowler as the plane began to slow down even more.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chickens were unaware that Mr. Tweedy had loosened some of his restraints, and was pulling on a loose rope attached to the plane. Ginger had an idea: “Turn her around, I’ll get the ramp.”
        </p>
        <p>
          As the plane turned around, Mr. Tweedy was thrown off balance; he let go of the rope and fell onto the ground. By this point, the amount of time Mr. Tweedy took to collect the chickens had begun to annoy Mrs. Tweedy, so she went to inspect his work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mrs. Tweedy was in complete shock of what she was witnessing. A chicken was running to set up a ramp while the other chickens were in a plane ready to take off. Directing her focus on the former chicken, she yelled, “Put that ramp down!” before aiming a deadly ax towards Ginger.
        </p>
        <p>
          “You are going to be a pie!” she yelled, throwing the ax.
        </p>
        <hr class="long">
        <h2 id="chapter9">Chapter 9: Grass and Peck-nics</h2>
        <p>
          Before the ax could make contact with Ginger, a whirl of brown and yellow colors once again intercepted Ginger and brought her to the ground. It was Rocky.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Ginger!”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Rocky!”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Heads up!” Rocky told Ginger, as Mrs. Tweedy continued to aim other dangerous objects towards the two chickens.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rocky whistled to Nick and Fletcher, “One more favor, boys?” he asked them. They grumbled indignantly, but dutifully went to distract Mrs. Tweedy.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Look out!” said Fowler, “Clear the runway!” Rocky and Ginger quickly lifted the runway and pushed until Fowler was able to fly high enough into the sky to pass the fence encasing the chicken coops.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Ginger, let’s go!” yelled Rocky, simultaneously reaching for Ginger and the rope hanging from the plane.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chickens quickly climbed the rope as best they could until they reached the crate, but Mrs. Tweedy had grabbed a hold of the end of the rope, and was dragging the plane down with her weight.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Great Dane, what is that?” asked Fowler.
        </p>
        <p>
          “A cling-on, Cap’n,” replied Mac, “And the engine can’t take it!”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Oh, goodness. Babs! Scissors!” yelled Ginger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Babs quickly disentangled a small pair of scissors from her knitting before passing them to Ginger. “Okay, now Rocky, lower me down.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “But, Ginger, I—” started Rocky.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Just do it!” said Ginger. Mrs. Tweedy was quickly climbing up the rope and was just a few feet away from Ginger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ginger fumbled with the scissors, attempting to cut at the rope. “Increase velocity,'' she heard Fowler command.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was Ginger’s moment. Mrs. Tweedy was mere seconds from chopping away at Ginger’s head when Ginger had an idea. “Rocky, I need you to pull me up on the count of three. One,” Mrs. Tweedy was swinging her arm back to gain momentum.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Two,” Mrs. Tweedy had identified her target and where she needed to swing.
        </p>
        <p>
          “THREE!” yelled Ginger and Mrs. Tweedy swung her arm back down and, instead of finding Ginger’s head there, found the rope instead. The rope was severed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rocky pulled Ginger up and embraced her in a hug, “Ginger,” he said softly, “I—” he continued in her ear as the chickens around them cheered (and blocked out what he said to the readers, unfortunately).
        </p>
        <p>
          Mrs. Tweedy had fallen back onto her farm and into the pie machine.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Mrs. Tweedy,” called out Mr. Tweedy, before noticing a red flashing light and a sign blinking from the machine saying DANGER. GRAVY PRESSURE. DO NOT BLOCK.
        </p>
        <p>
          In just a few moments, as Mr. Tweedy stood by and watched from afar, the pie machine exploded. “I told you them was organized.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Back on the plane, the chickens were ecstatic as they made their way past the hill on the plane. “We did it, everyone!” said Ginger as the chickens cheered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rocky quickly grabbed a hold of Ginger and kissed her.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Aww! Whoo!” the chickens laughed and cheered again.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Keep pedaling!” yelled Fowler, trying to distract the chickens to give Ginger and Rocky a little more privacy. “We’re not there just yet! You can’t see paradise if you don’t pedal! Put your drumsticks into it!”
        </p>
        <hr class="short">
        <p>
          “So, is it as good as you imagined?” asked Rocky, peering around at the fresh, green grass surrounding them.
        </p>
        <p>
          “No. It’s even better,” replied Ginger before hugging Rocky.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Come on, I’ll show you how to play football!” The two chickens ran off, and all that could be heard, aside from the football game, was the light conversation of Nick and Fletcher.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Hey, here’s a thought. Why don’t we get an egg and start our own chicken farm?” asked Nick, “That way, we’ll have all the eggs we can eat!”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Right,” said Fletcher, “We’ll need a chicken then!”
        </p>
        <p>
          “No, no, we’ll need an egg. You have the egg first, that’s where the chicken comes from.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “No. If you don’t have a chicken, where you gonna get an egg?”, the conversation continued.
        </p>
