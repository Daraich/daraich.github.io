            All is quiet, then, the Mission Impossible music begins to play. The lights come on, and we see a series of shots of the chickens, led by Ginger, planning and executing elaborate escapes that never quite work. Mr. Tweedy and his guard dogs chase the chickens. Eventually, Mr. Tweedy catches Ginger and throws her into solitary confinement.

            INT. HUT 17
          </p>
          <p>
            The scene opens downstage center (in front of closed front curtain) with all of the hens gathering in Hut 17. They wait to hear of GINGER’s latest plan. Before the meeting, she speaks with NICK and FLETCHER, the rats, off to the side.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3>NICK</h3>
            <p>
              You called? Nick and..

            <h3>FETCHER</h3>
            <p>
              Fetcher!

            <h3>NICK</h3>
            <p>
              At your service. Now, what can we do for you, miss?
            </p>
            <h3>GINGER</h3>
            <p>
              We need some more things.
            </p>
            <h3>NICK</h3>
            <p>
              Of course, miss. But before we discuss what you need, let’s discuss payment.
            </p>
            <h3>GINGER</h3>

              Absolutely not. Those are too valuable!

            <p>
              Well, then, pleasure doing business with you madame, good night!
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            NICK and FETCHER walk exit left. GINGER stands there a moment, looking defeated. She returns to the meeting. The chickens are down low to the ground. They ad. lib. a meeting, then hit an interesting tableau. Front curtain opens.
          </p>
          <p>
            On a raised platform is MR. TWEEDY’s office where MRS. TWEEDY is viewing an ad for a pie machine. Meanwhile, MR. TWEEDY is staring out a window, spying on the chickens.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3>MR. TWEEDY</h3>
            <p>
              I don’t trust those chickens. They are up to something.
            </p>
            <h3>MRS. TWEEDY</h3>
            <p>
              (Absorbed in the ad and paying no heed to her husband)
            </p>
            <p>
              Would you shut up! They’re chickens, they are too dumb to organize.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            MRS. TWEEDY freezes in tableau as MR. TWEEDY’s ​They’re Organizing song begins.​ At the end of the song, the front curtain closes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The chicken meeting breaks tableau and comes into full action. GINGER is explaining the latest escape plan.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3>GINGER</h3>
            <p>
              It’s a catapult, ladies! And, no, Helia, we are not going to start a fire! Look, Mac is in charge ofmechanics and we will help assemble the catapult!
            </p>
            <h3>BUNTY</h3>
            <p>
              (Looking out stage left, where MR. TWEEDY enters shortly.)
            </p>
            <p>
              Mr. Tweedy is coming!
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            All the chickens immediately start tidying up and rushing into their beds.
          </p>
          <p>
            MR. TWEEDY opens the door to the hut and sees all the hens asleep in their bed. He looks confused, but closes the door and walks back to the main house.
          </p>
          <p>
            The chickens wait until they hear MR. TWEEDY walk away before getting back out of their beds.
          </p>
          <p>
            GINGER stands up, and looks out at all the hens.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3>GINGER</h3>
            <p>
              We can’t keep living here! In constant fear. The only permissions we get are to sleep, eat, and lay eggs. And our precious eggs are stolen from us every day! Don’t you all want to be free? To feel the sun on your face and the grass under your feet?
            </p>
            <h3>BUNTY</h3>
            <p>
              But why do we need those things? We are taken care of here. If we leave, all that goes away.
            </p>
            <h3>GINGER</h3>
            <p>
              What about Edwina? They took her away from us. How many open nests will it take?
            </p>
            <h3>BUNTY</h3>
            <p>
              Maybe it wouldn’t be empty if she’d spent more time layin’ and less time escapin’!
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            The chickens gasp in shock! BUNTY shrugs.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3>GINGER</h3>
            <p>
              So laying eggs all your life, and then
              getting plucked, stuffed, and roasted is
              good enough for you, is it?
            </p>
            <h3>BABS</h3>
            <p>
              It’s a livin’.
            </p>
            <h3>GINGER</h3>
            <p>
              You know what the problem is? The fences aren’t just round the farm. They’re up here in your heads. There’s a better place out there somewhere beyond that hill, and it has wide open spaces and lots of trees and grass. Can you imagine that? Cool, green grass.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            None of the chickens look convinced and they turn away from her, ready to sleep. Out of frustration, GINGER exits left. Lights out.
          </p>
          <p>
            End Scene.

            The chickens exit the scene, the front curtain is opened to reveal Ginger outside of all the coops, which are lined in a neat row behind her. She walks downstage, center. Frustrated, she punches the fence.
          </p>
          <p>
            FOWLER hears her punch the fence and looks out of a coop. He walks out from the coop.

          <p>
            A scream is heard in the distance. GINGER and FOWLER react and look up to see ROCKY the rooster “flying” above the chicken farm.
          </p>

            ROCKY crashes into the weather vane and falls inside the fence in front of GINGER. He is knocked unconscious.

            GINGER catches a torn flyer that shows ROCKY flying with the words “Rocky the Flying Rooster”. She cheats out towards the house to demonstrate the poster to the audience. GINGER suddenly gets an idea.

            MR. TWEEDY walks outside patrolling the farm with DOG 1 and DOG 2. They walk around the coops with a flashlight before exiting stage right.
          </p>
          <p>
            After he exits, the chickens rush to Hut 17 one by one. GINGER and the CHICKENS stand around ROCKY’s unconscious body.

              You're right. Excuse us, we are just very excited you’re here. This is a chicken farm.
            </p>
            <h3>BABS</h3>
            <p>
              And we're the chickens.

            <h3>FOWLER</h3>
            <p>
              I’m not too sure about this one. He has a funny look about him.

            <h3>ROCKY</h3>
            <p>
              Hey, what's up with Grandpa?
            </p>
            <h3>GINGER</h3>
            <p>
              Oh, don't mind him, Mister... ?

            <h3>ROCKY</h3>
            <p>
              Rocky. Rocky the Rhode Island Red. Rhodes for short.
            </p>
            <h3>GINGER</h3>
            <p>
              Is this you Mr. Rhodes?

            </p>
            <h3>GINGER</h3>
            <p>
              You see, us chickens are in a rather desperate situation. If it is you, you might be able to help us!
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            All the chickens stare intently at ROCKY.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3>ROCKY</h3>
            <p>
              Well I must be what you’ve been waiting for all along, because that’s me.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>Rocky’s song (EGO DRIVEN)</p>
          <p>The chickens all clap for ROCKY and chat excitedly. He speaks, simultaneously making his way towards the door.</p>
          <div>
            <h3>ROCKY</h3>
            <p>
              (Confidently)
            </p>
            <p>
              See, I can’t stay in one place for too long. I lived in a barnyard for a while, but couldn’t do it permanently. The open road is more my style. In fact, they call me the Lone Ranger where I come from.
            </p>
            <h3>GINGER</h3>
            <p>
              I knew it could happen. We are going to fly over that fence. And you’re going to show us how!
            </p>
            <h3>ROCKY</h3>
            <p>
              Uhhmm... hold on. You want me to teach you to fly?
            </p>
            <h3>GINGER</h3>
            <p>
              Yes. Don’t you see it, we can ​all​ escape out of here if we can fly.
            </p>
            <h3>ROCKY</h3>
            <p>
              Oh I couldn’t do that. In fact, I should be on my way, actually (pauses and cranes his neck to listen) that’s the open road calling my name.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            ROCKY runs out the door quickly. He quickly walks downstage, slowly pacing from left to right. GINGER follows. The lights dim for the chickens upstage, who hit a tableau.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3>GINGER</h3>
            <p>
              Mr. Rhodes! Wait, please! Let me explain our situation more clearly. We lay eggs every day. And when we can’t anymore, we’re killed. Do you understand? We’re dead chickens if we stay here!
            </p>
            <h3>ROCKY</h3>
            <p>
              (Distracted by a non-existent noise in the distance)
            </p>
            <p>
              It's a tough world doll face.
            </p>
            <h3>GINGER</h3>
            <p>
              Need I repeat that they kill us when we can’t lay eggs anymore! Escaping is our only option.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            ROCKY stops in his tracks and turns to GINGER.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3>ROCKY</h3>
            <p>

            <h3>GINGER</h3>
            <p>
              Yes! That’s what I’ve been saying this entire time!

            <h3>ROCKY</h3>
            <p>
              You’re crazy! Pulling off a stunt like that would be suicide.
            </p>
            <h3>GINGER</h3>
            <p>
              Where there is a will, there is a way.

            <h3>ROCKY</h3>
            <p>
              Yes, and I’ll be leaving that way.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            ROCKY walks stage left to exit. There are two bright “headlights” shine before him, he runs back center. The sound of a bus horn is heard. ROCKY panics and runs to GINGER.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3>ROCKY</h3>
            <p>

          </div>
          <p>
            GINGER grabs his wing and takes him to the right side of the farthest right coop upstage. A bus enters downstage left. The bus reads “Circus.” CIRCUS MAN steps out of the bus and peers out into the house. MR. TWEEDY enters downstage right and stairs at CIRCUS MAN. The downstage lights dim and the lights near GINGER and ROCKY increase in brightness.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3>GINGER</h3>
            <p>
              So, you’re from the circus and you’re on the run aren’t you? There’s no reason I shouldn’t turn you in right now.
            </p>
            <h3>ROCKY</h3>
            <p>
              You’re crazy, do you know what they’ll do to me if they catch me?
            </p>
            <h3>GINGER</h3>
            <p>
              Like you said, it's a tough world. We all have our own problems.
            </p>
            <h3>ROCKY</h3>
            <p>
              I just realized, I don’t think I like you.
            </p>
            <h3>GINGER</h3>
            <p>
              I don’t care. You’re going to show us how to fly or I’m going to start screaming right now.
            </p>
            <h3>ROCKY</h3>
            <p>
              No!

            CUT TO:
          </p>
          <p>
            The man from the bus, MR. TWEEDY, and MRS. TWEEDY are all stage center. They are all gathered at the front door of the house, and the man has already asked if they had seen ROCKY. The chickens move back into their own coops upstage.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3>MRS. TWEEDY</h3>
            <p>
              He’s valuable? Get the torch Mr. Tweedy.

          <div>
            <h3>ROCKY</h3>
            <p>
              Listen Doll Face. I’m not going back to that life. I’m a Lone Free Ranger.
            </p>
            <h3>GINGER</h3>
            <p>
              Exactly! That’s what we all want for ourselves. Freedom.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            They can then see light from MRS. TWEEDY’s flashlight as she turns it on. She and MR. TWEEDY enter the gate at center.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3>GINGER</h3>
            <p>
              How about this. If you teach us to fly, we’ll keep you hidden here at the farm. Deal?
            </p>
            <h3>ROCKY</h3>
            <p>
              Deal.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            GINGER then rushes ROCKY to the chicken coup stage left, and knocks on the door. They are dragged inside quickly. MRS. TWEEDY hears sound coming from the area of the coup. She opens the roof to see all the chickens sleeping and closes it. GINGER opens a small box in which ROCKY was hiding in, and takes him out.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3>GINGER</h3>
            <p>
              Now that we’ve held up our part of the agreement. Tomorrow, first thing in the morning, we’ll be ready to learn how to fly.
            </p>
            <h3>ROCKY</h3>
            <p>
              Sure thing! I’ll teach you everything I know. Now, where should I sleep?
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            All the chickens shout “Me! Me!” from their bunks.

            The chicken moves are moved downstage while a platform is brought out upstage. MR. TWEEDY’s house is on the platform. Pan onto outside of HUT 12, where ROCKY is standing in front of the hut and all the other chickens are gathered around listening to him.

              Flying requires three very important qualities. Hard work, perseverance, and ... hard work.

            <h3>FOWLER</h3>
            <p>

            <p>
              Well, it takes twice the amount of hard work as perseverance to fly.

            With “Fight For Your Right” playing in the background, the chickens start exercising together as a group. This includes moving their wings back and forth, raising their wings up, and doing pushups. MR. TWEEDY sees them doing push-ups from his house upstage. He rushes to show MRS. TWEEDY.

          <p>
            The chickens, hearing a small commotion in MR. TWEEDY’s house, return to innocently pecking the ground and doing chickenly things. MRS. TWEEDY hits MR. TWEEDY in the head with her clipboard and walks away. MR. TWEEDY enters a tableau upstage, reading the newspaper.

            Pan to GINGER on top of the roof, runs and jumps off the roof flapping her wings. She thinks she is flying for a few seconds, then realizes she has just landed on a large pile of her fellow chickens who also tried flying off the roof. The entire pile falls down. NICK and FLETCHER laugh in the background. All the chickens grumble away to their huts, dejected and exhausted.

            Suddenly, the ground starts shaking (indicated by the chickens wobbling around and falling down). An earthquake sound is heard along with the sound of a truck.

            MR. TWEEDY exits tableau. MRS. TWEEDY enters upstage right (from atop the platform). The truck is up center and all the chickens are staring at it. The words “POULTRY PRODUCTS” can be seen on the side of the truck. The truck then opens and automatically moves out a massive metal machine in crates carried by chains. MR. TWEEDY directs the truck to put the machine in the house and the chickens are standing there stunned, not knowing what the contraption is. The truck closes and starts to drive off, as the chickens look on with binoculars at the machine.

          <p>
            Two coops are set upstage, left and right. MR. TWEEDY’s house, the platform, and the trucky are striked. ROCKY is stage center surrounded by the chickens.

            The chickens laugh in response to the punchline. Soft harmonica jazz music begins playing in the background. ROCKY takes a drink of water from a cocktail-shaped funnel.

              Guys, you are without a doubt the sneakiest, most light-fingered thieving parasites I've ever met.

            <h3>NICK</h3>

              I didn't lie, doll face. I just omitted certain truths. I'll give them exactly what I promised.

            The front curtain closes midway on ROCKY. ROCKY exits. The chickens enter from upstage the curtain and cross downstage left. Rooftop is removed. FOWLER “Cock-a-doodle-doo”’s off-stage to indicate a new day.

            GINGER notices the medal and a piece of paper left on FOWLER’s bed. She goes to read it. Her (distraught) reaction should be visible to the audience.
          </p>
          <p>
            GINGER walks back up the chickens. The chickens cease tableau and begin to ad lib. about stretching, flying, etc.

            The chickens turn to GINGER, and a hush falls upon them.

          <p>
            GINGER shows them the paper, and connects her own piece of flyer to reveal a sign that says “In Town For One Week Only” with Rocky being thrust from a cannon. A thunderclap can be heard in the background as the realization sets in.

            The hens all gasp. They chatter amongst themselves, speculating why ROCKY left and even blaming each other for his departure (accusing one another of bad behavior). A fight breaks out.

            NICK and FLETCHER steal tools upstage on the platform as MR. TWEEDY continues to fix the broken pie machine. The tools are passed to the hens who begin to disassemble anything and everything they can. Some chickens collect wood and nails to build the plane.

            GINGER and ROCKY continue chattering and exit stage left. MAC, BUNTY, BABS and the other chickens tidy up their activities very slowly.

              Hey, Fletcher. Here’s an idea. Why don’t we get an egg, and start our own chicken farm? That way, we can have eggs all you can eat!
            </p>
            <h3>FLETCHER</h3>
            <p>
              Right. We’ll need a chicken then!
            </p>
            <h3>NICK</h3>
            <p>
              No, no. We’ll need an egg. You have an egg first. That’s where the chicken comes from.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            All chickens exit the stage, one by one so as to not raise much attention.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3>FLETCHER</h3>
            <p>
              Cobblers! If you don’t have a chicken, where you gonna get an egg from?
            </p>
            <h3>NICK</h3>
            <p>
              From the chicken that comes from the egg.
            </p>
            <h3>FLETCHER</h3>
            <p>
              Where’s the egg come from then?
            </p>
            <h3>NICK</h3>
            <p>
              Oy, where’d everyone go?
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            NICK and FLETCHER look around. Upstage, GINGER and ROCKY enter tossing each other the football. The other chickens join in.
          </p>
          <p>
            NICK turns on the radio beside him.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3>NICK</h3>
            <p>
              Fancy some scrambled eggs Fletcher? Let’s
              go play some game!
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Hearing the music, the football game quickly turns into a dance. The dance transitions into the final bows of the actors.
          </p>
          <div>
            <p>
              First round of bows:​ BABS, BUNTY, and EDWINA, followed by extra chickens

            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            The music fades and the actors take one last bow.
          </p>
          <p>
            End Scene.
