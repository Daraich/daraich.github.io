            Introductory music: Mission Impossible.
            Elaborate escape plans (that never work), all chickens needed.

            Edwina is killed as Ginger watches from a rooftop

            They're up here in your heads. There's a better place out there somewhere 
            beyond that hill, and it has wide open spaces and lots of trees, and grass. 
            Can you imagine that? Cool, green grass.

            Ginger leaves the meeting, walks outside in distress

          <li>
            Rocky is introduced into the film as he haphazardly “flies” into the coop 
            (making his grand entrance after crashing into the weather vane;  
            he is knocked unconscious)
          </li>

            Ginger catches a poster of Rocky that floats from the sky;  
            orders other hens to get this mysterious newcomer inside (Rocky); 
            they do so hastily as  Mr. Tweedy approaches the coop
          </li>
          <li>
            The chickens realize who rocky is (comparing him to the poster);

            Training begins. “Fight for your Right” from Beastie Boys 
            plays (with a few lyrics changes).
          </li>
          <li>
            Mr. Tweedy notices the chickens exercising and calls this out to Mrs. Tweedy. 
            He goes to take a better look towards the end of their bootcamp.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ginger points out to Rocky that no one is actually flying, 
            but everyone is actually exhausted from all the work.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rocky begins “teaching how to fly” by having chickens run up a ramp, 
            flap their wings, and fall into a pile of hay
          </li>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, Nick and Fletcher make puns about the entire ordeal from downstage.
          </li>
          <li>
            They hear an approaching noise: a large truck. Rocky thinks it's the circus, 
            but it's actually the pie machine that has just arrived. They hide Rocky.
          </li>
          <li>
            While Rocky is “hidden,” let's have a sort of pantomime scene where the 
            chickens are frozen watching Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mac speaks to Ginger about the logistical issues of a chicken flying.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fowler comments on Rocky’s character, and how he is “not to be trusted”

            The next day. Ginger speaks with Rocky about the limited time they have to escape.

          <li>
            Rocky has already exchanged some deals with Nick and Fletcher to find the 
            “thrust” to propel the chickens forward.

          <li>
            Chickens keep training.

          <li>
            They are suddenly given more feed. Chickens act excitedly. Mrs. 
            Tweedy walks down stage, the runner curtain closes. Scene transitions into...

          <li>
            Mrs. Tweedy’s I Want Song. After the song, she walks off stage and the

          </li>
          <li>
            Ginger in the midst of enlightening the chickens as to why they are being fed extra.
            General uproar, but also general sadness.

          <li>
            Rocky cuts off Ginger’s speech and has a talk with her 
            about motivation and encouragement.
          </li>

            where Nick and Fetcher bring the props (lights and a radio, decorations) 
            for the dance and Rocky promises them an egg (a bit of a comic relief moment)
          </li>
          <li>
            Rocky turns on the radio while Nick and Fetcher put up the lights and

            Ginger dances with Rocky

            So… it would be three songs in total, and we would theoretically cut the

            Rocky learns Ginger has been taken; Fowler tells him to fly over there

          <li>
            Rocky and Ginger run back to the pens to tell the rest of the 
            chickens what’s going on
          </li>
          <li>
            The other chickens are all still in the dark, and are all stressed and anxious
          </li>
          <li>
            When Ginger and Rocky tell them what happened, mass panic ensues
          </li>
          <li>
            Once Ginger calms them down, she tells them it’s ok, because 
            Rocky is finally going to teach them how to fly
          </li>
          <li>
            Rocky feels guilty, and goes back to the room he shares with Fowler
          </li>
          <li>
            Once he gets there, Fowler tells him what he did was very brave and honorable
          </li>
          <li>
            Fowler gives him the medal of bravery and salutes him
          </li>
          <li>
            Fowler also gives Rocky the bunk and goes outside to sleep
          </li>
          <li>
            Rocky is contemplating up on the roof, where he is joined by Ginger
          </li>
          <li>
            They have a bit of an awkward interaction, but eventually they 
            calm down and sit together
          </li>
          <li>
            Ginger thanks him for all he’s done, and tells him that she’s 
            never felt grass before
          </li>
          <li>
            Rocky tells her that the outside world isn’t as exciting as she thinks it is
          </li>
          <li>
            He wants to tell her the truth but he is too nervous
          </li>
          <li>
            They touch hands, and both get nervous
          </li>
          <li>
            Ginger leaves, and as she's walking away, Rocky calls her Ginger for the first time
          </li>
          <li>
            The next morning all the hens are gathering around, and are excited to fly
          </li>
          <li>
            Ginger hangs up the poster of Rocky
          </li>
          <li>
            She then goes to his bunk to find him
          </li>
          <li>
            Once she gets to the bunk, she finds the medal of valor, a
            nd the bottom half of Rocky’s poster
          </li>
          <li>
            She realizes Rocky has left
          </li>
          <li>
            She goes back out to there the other hens are waiting
          </li>
          <li>
            She hangs up the bottom half of the poster
          </li>
          <li>
            The new poster reveals that Rocky used a cannon in order to fly during the circus
          </li>
          <li>
            Rocky has dug out under the fence, and has left
          </li>
          <li>
            Back in the coop, the hens descend into chaos
          </li>
          <li>
            They are all turning on each other and fighting

        <h3>By Naomi Mau</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Chickens decide to build a plane.
          </li>
          <li>
            They enlist the help of Nick and Fetcher (and actually give them eggs)
          </li>
          <li>
            Chickens begin constructing the flying machine while 
            Mr. Tweedy simultaneously fixes the pie machine.
          </li>
          <li>
            Overlapping desires of chickens and Mr. Tweedy
          </li>
          <li>
            Jukebox or original song plays while: Mac gives directions, everyone gets to work
          </li>
          <li>
            As Mr. Tweedy finishes the pie machine, the chickens panic
          </li>
          <li>
            They are bought some time as Mr. Tweedy tells Mrs. Tweedy of his accomplishment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mr. Tweedy goes to get ALL the chickens
          </li>
          <li>
            More panic
          </li>
          <li>
            The plane is finished, but Fowler cannot fly it!
          </li>
          <li>
            Small debate about whether Fowler can fly the plane or not.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fowler flies over a ramp (but fails as the ramp needs to be higher).
          </li>
          <li>
            Ginger goes to prop the ramp.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mr. Tweedy interferes with Ginger
          </li>
          <li>
            Rocky returns to help Ginger
          </li>
          <li>
            The ramp works: Ginger and Rocky quickly grab hole of the rope 
            attached to the plane.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy also grab a hold of the rope until they 
            fall back onto the farm.
          </li>
          <li>
            As the plane flies away, Mrs. Tweedy falls into the pie machine 
            ultimately destroying the pie machine.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mr. Tweedy stands there to watch.
