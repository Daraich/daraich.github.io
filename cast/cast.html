          <li><b>Ginger: </b>leader of the group; makes an effort to listen and understand others; stubborn; she wants freedom but not at the expense of a single chicken; will die for her beliefs</li>
          <li><b>Rocky: </b>epitome of how other countries view Americans; overly optimistic, even during depressing moments; cowardly; has the same goal as Ginger--freedom--but he will not risk his life if he can help it

          <li><b>Mrs. Tweedy: </b>stern and severe; really struggling to survive in the competitive egg industry; probably frustrated by her dissolving marriage</li>
          <li><b>Mr. Tweedy: </b>Mrs. Tweedy’s minion; shows strongest character development at the end with his wife; in a similar situation as the chickens: he wants freedom from his wife, but cannot find a way to this freedom
          </li>
          <li><b>Babs: </b>a little aloof; distracts herself with knitting; sweet; extremely wise in the ways of the world, but acts naive because it is easier to cope that way</li>
          <li><b>Bunty: </b>bossy, yet motherly; she is the reality check of the group</li>
          <li><b>Edwina: </b>extremely book smart, but does not stand up for herself; she will not offer up her vast wisdom unless she is prompted</li>
          <li><b>Fowler: </b>the first chicken to die; martyr; cares more about freedom than her life</li>
          <li><b>Nick: </b>leader of the two rats; knows what he wants in life: an egg; the classic comic relief

              For Ginger, we have selected female actors who have experience in delivering delineated characters. They have had leading and title roles and as empowering women, and they are known for their prolific acting styles and multifarious production genres they have participated in. They have the neat, upright, yet sweet profile we look for in Ginger; they can also uphold a sense of solidarity with the leadership qualities. Our first choice is Emily Blunt because she has an outstanding record of portraying strong female lead, she was cast in Sicario (2015) as a potent and sensitive federal agent and in Edge of Tomorrow (2014) as an intelligent and capable soldier. She possesses the ability to portray Ginger who is stern and exudes leader qualities. Ginger not only can have everything under control but also is highly intelligent and bright, she is the one to come up with prctical ideas, and Emily Blunt is able to demonstrate sharpness in her characters. Our choice of understudy follows the logic and process of our first choice. Kerry Washington is known for her role Olivia Pope in Scandal (2012-2018), a calm and prolific crisis management expert. Her potential of illustrating a leader type character like Ginger is excellent. And the same goes with Mara Wilson.

              The character Rocky is a charming American rooster, an exemplary and even stereotypical American blockbuster production’s male lead. Rocky appears to be a laid-back guy who is witty and frivolous playboy, and he strikes people as selfish and just a tiny bit cynical. Yet as the film unfolds, his virtuous qualities are shown as he is optimistic and righteous, and his slight cowardly personality would be overcome. Our first choice is Chris Pratt who is a prolific actor who can handle complex characterizations and have extensive experience and skills in the comedy genre. Chris Pratt’s characters Star Lord in his huge hit Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) is marvelously portrayed with character traits very similar to Rocky. Jay Hayden, as an understudy, also has significant involvement in comedy genre productions. He has the required skills to illustrate a lightly narcissist and spiritual role. Robbie Amell has established an optimistic and charismatic character, Nathan Brown, in TV series Upload (2020). He renders substantial potential as a patriotic and upright Rocky.

              Mrs. Tweedy is quite an exceptional character. For this role, we have chosen Helena Bonham Carter as our first choice to portray this character, with Charlize Theron and Nicole Kidman as her understudies. At surface level, Mrs. Tweedy is the definition of heartless and wicked: she cares more about making money off her economic escapades than she does for her animals that do all the work. On closer inspection, we find a few details that humanize this character: Mrs. Tweedy is a powerful woman in an industry typically dominated by men; she does not play the docile gender role that is typical of women in her time; she is a stern, unrelenting woman who refuses to be poor. Helena Bonham Carter has proved herself adept at portraying different versions of powerful women. Our focus on her work includes her more grotesque, dramatic, and chaotically evil depictions in film, including (though not limited to): the Queen of Hearts in Alice and Wonderland (2010), Mrs. Lovett in Sweeney Todd (2007), Emily in Corpse Bride (2005), and Bellatrix Lestrange in Harry Potter (2001-2011). We believe Helena will breathe life into this character and give Mrs. Tweedy the humanity that antagonists often lack. In addition, we have chosen other actresses, Charlize Theron and Nicole Kidman, who are also capable of playing such a powerful role. Charlize Theron’s work in Snow White and the Huntsman (2012) is remarkable, as well as Elizabeth Banks’ work in the Hunger Games (2012-2015) films and Charlie’s Angels (2019).

              Mr. Tweedy’s internal conflict could be a movie on its own. He is in a struggling marriage where he is neither respected nor heard; his worries are always dismissed, and he must continuously convince himself that his anxiety is imagined. He projects his inner turmoil on the chickens: they, too, cannot escape from the farm and find freedom from Mrs. Tweedy, though this is what they most yearn for. In our rendition of Chicken Run, we would pull out a different side of Mr. Tweedy, the side that more closely resembles his character before and after marriage. For this role, we have chosen Danny DeVito as our first choice actor, followed by Mark Ruffalo and Johnny Depp as his understudies. We would like to introduce a more goofy side of Mr. Tweedy, and Danny DeVito would do this perfectly. Mrs. Tweedy truly corrupts all whom she commands; this would be prominent in scenes between Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy, where Mr. Tweedy acts as passive and subservient. However, when he is by himself, Mr. Tweedy should act more relaxed (even when he is surveying the chickens!). Danny DeVito has played more goofy characters in the past such as Louie De Palma in the TV series Taxi (1978); he is also capable of playing evil characters such as his role as Harry Wormwood in Matilda (1996); lastly, he is capable of playing more serious characters such as his role as the Lorax in the Lorax (2012) film. Danny DeVito’s range is perfect for the dynamic and complex character of Mr. Tweedy. We have casted Mark Ruffalo and Johnny Depp as understudies for this role. Mark Ruffalo might play this role more gently as he did for his work in the film 13 Going on 30; he would build sympathy from the audience for his character. Johnny Depp has a large range when it comes to acting, and we would encourage him to play this role as a little more chaotic, but still under the command of his wife.

              As stated in the character descriptions above, Babs is a little aloof because she is afraid to confront her reality in the farm. We have chosen actresses who have demonstrated their ability to act in this fashion, including Alison Sudol, Margot Robbie, and Anya Taylor-Joy. In Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016), Alison Sudol portrays a mysterious, playful woman who is incredibly, though secretly, clever. Margot Robbie also portrays a fun character in her role as Flopsy in Peter Rabbit (2018). As for Anya Taylor-Joy, though her works tend to be more serious, we apply her acting skills from the film Emma (2020) where she portrays a young woman who is utterly clueless about the ways of the world, though she believes herself much wiser. Each of these actresses is apt to play the sophisticated, yet fun and silly, role of Babs. Margot Robbie is best known for her role as Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad in which she plays a coquettish and utterly playful villain. She has the method acting style where she can challenge Babs’s character, and her other character is more convincing which is Sharon Tate in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Sharon is innocent, sweet, and can be oblivious from time to time which matches Babs’s characterization. Margot Robbie definitely has the talent and experience to deliver another great performance.

              This character is illustrated as the semi-mother figure in the group. Taraji P. Henson delivered a caring and independent motherly role in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2009). She is a prolific actress who can handle a layered role who is kind, righteous, and will knock sense into others. Octavia Spencer’s range of works is expertly broad, judging from her previous experience, she can portray and excel at any role from a comedic character to drama and horror films’ lead. In her recent work, The Witches (2020), she has delivered a wise, caring, and strong-willed grandmother figure. With a little modification in acting, she can sure be a perfect Bunty. Helen Mirren is our third choice, she has a history of playing an extensive selection of all kinds of characters which range from tough killer to caring mother. She can deliver a believable character, and she has more than enough experience in depicting motherly figures.

              This character encompasses a young woman who is booksmart, but also reserved and shy to the extent where she will not stand up for herself. At first, we thought of Emma Watson, who is the classic example of a booksmart actress, both on-screen and off; however, Emma’s characters, and she as a person, will stand up for her voice. Mac is not that type of character. Though Hailee Steinfeld, Mackenzie Foy, and Chloe Moretz might advocate for themselves off camera, they would still be perfect for this role. We highlight Hailee Seinfeld’s work in Pitch Perfect 3 (2017), where she plays a socially awkward girl with a highly gifted voice. Each actress has a slightly more reserved, yet humble nature that we would like to capture in Mac. Mackenzie Foy’s performance of Murphy in Interstellar (2014) is sophisticated at such a young age, Murphy is extremely intelligent and headstrong, yet her good nature has provided her with generosity and empathy. This character has so many layers that move into different phases that require a comprehensive acting skill, Mackenzie has exhibited highly professional and well-rounded depictions as a young actor. Chole Moretz’s role, Hit-Girl in Kick-Ass series (2010-2013) is also a smart girl with astonishing talents, she gave a terrific performance as a bright determined girl, which is what we look for in Mac’s character.

              Fowler is a character with distinctive personalities and character traits. Fowler is firm, even a bit of stubborn, and honest rooster. Patrick Stewart’s six decades spanning career has included rich character types to choose from. He has the quality to express the layered and wise characters, a fine example being Professor Charles Xavier in the 20th Fox’s production X-Men series (2000 - 2020). He possesses  the archaic vibe of a golden age actor and the masterful acting skills to complete Fowler. Elliot Gould excels at delivering old time gentleman figures with an ingredient of wittiness. His renowned role of a con artist Reuben Tishkoff in Ocean's Eleven series (2001-2007) matches Fowler’s characterization to a high degree, and he is a potent actor to master a variety of portrayals. John Noble is our third choice but he is every bit of potent as any other choice for this character. His acting style is prolific for he is known for portraying exceptionally contrasting characters in the same program, which is a strong factor we take into consideration in casting. His characters of Dr. Walter Bishop from Fringe (2008-2013) and Denethor in The Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001-2003) are distinctive yet sophisticatedly rendered figures of a wise and indelible character. He has the ability to portray such characters who remind people of an older time which suits Fowler.

We make note of James Corden in his well-known television series The Late Late Show with James Corden; Jack Black for his roles in the Kung Fu Panda (2008-2016) films, Nacho Libre (2016), and the Jumanji films (2017 - 2019); and Will Ferrell in almost all of his film roles. For Fletcher, we chose actors who would work well as side-kicks, but would also be amusing. We note Taron Egerton’s work in the film Sing (2016), and the entire personalities of Tom Holland and Harry Styles off-camera. If casted and played correctly, Nick and Fletcher are likely to steal the hearts of our audience. James Corden and Taron Egerton would be the first choice for pairing up as the eventual theatrical production, not only they fit in the characters perfectly as respective characters, they generate outstanding chemistry as a team. On more than one occasion, James and Taron have teamed up on the screen such as during The Late Late Show with James Corden (2016). Their dynamic is irreplaceable and they hit it off naturally. The chemistry between actors is a myth and James and Taron master this as amazing performers.
