        <h3>By Asha Briscoe</h3>
        <div id="interview">
          <h4>
            Welcome back to 106.8’s Celebrity News! Today we have the pleasure of talking to the legendary Danny DeVito about an upcoming film, a musical adaptation of Nick Park’s animated classic; Chicken Run!
          </h4>
          <br>
          <h4>
            Danny it’s truly an honor to be speaking with you here today, all of us here at 106.8 are huge fans of yours.
          </h4>
          <p>
            -Thanks very much errrr… what’s your name again?
          </p>
          <h4>
            Oh, it’s Olivier Doyle...We spoke on the phone, I was told you requested me specifically?
          </h4>
          <p>
            -Oh no no no I said I wanted some OLIVE OIL… Sorry kid no offense never heard of you in my life. I’m the chef on set ya see, I got the best pasta sauce recipes around. But some goofy intern forgot to get me the Costco size, and that just won’t cut it, I got a whole cast to feed! They come crowd around the trailer every night around dinner time when they smell the italian spices wafting across the set.
          </p>
          <h4>
            No worries! Should’ve guessed as much. Speaking of cooking, in the film you play Mr. Tweedy, husband of the evil, attempted chicken-pie maker Mrs. Tweedy. Do you, or would you, ever make chicken pies for your fellow cast members?
          </h4>
          <p>
            -Never. Everyone and their mother is a vegetarian or a vegan these days. It comes and goes in phases, but I can never keep up! Safer to make something everyone can enjoy. Also, it feels a little strange to feed chicken to a bunch of people who just came off a set where they pretended to be chickens for 12 hours…
          </p>
          <h4>
            (laughs) Fair enough. How are you feeling about being in another musical? I absolutely loved you as Phil in the Hercules animated film.
          </h4>
          <p>
            -I’m pretty excited about it. I love to mix it up now and again, and it’ll be funny being known for a live action musical film this time around. The animated ones with just voice acting tend to be a little easier, cause you get to hide behind your character a little more. I guess that didn’t really apply in Hercules cause they kinda made Phil look just like me… but hey, I loved the role. It was super fun to be a part of that one, and I can’t wait for you all to see this new one!
          </p>
          <h4>
            We can’t wait either! Speaking of, Mr. Tweedy is also a short chubby man in the animated film. Do you think that had any reason to do with their casting choice?
          </h4>
          <p>
            -Watch your mouth Doyle. I’ve got a condition you ass-wipe. Just ‘cause I’m a small guy doesn’t mean I’ll take any shit from some kid on a second rate talk show with a unibrow and a bow-tie. And no, I think they casted me cause I’ve been in this business for longer than you’ve been alive, and I’m good at what I do.
          </p>
          <h4>
            (nervously fiddles with bow-tie) I-I’m so sorry Mr. Devito I didn’t mean to offend! I just meant… does it ever bother you? Being cast in roles that seem to kind of make fun of your appearance? 
          </h4>
          <p>
            -Relax kid, I’m mostly messing with you. You couldn’t offend me if you tried! I’ve got more confidence in my four feet and ten inches than most of the world has put together. And no, it doesn’t bother me. I’m an actor. I’m also a small, round and funny guy! Every actor has to deal with type-casting in one way or another, and when you’ve been doing this as long as I have, you’ve played enough roles that being the short chubby dude now and again really isn’t that big of a deal. At least I never have to worry about being the hot skinny blonde! Those girls have it worse… all day on a machine like a hamster just to have a couple lines and a carwash scene where no one remembers what they look like from the neck up! 
          </p>
          <h4>
            Huh. I guess you’re right! I never really thought about it like that. Well moving on, I’ve taken a look at the roles for this film and wow! What an interesting cast! Who has been your favorite person to work with on set?
          </h4>
          <p>
            -I’ve had fun with everyone on the set! It’s a little funny being in a cast with so many kids who are big names already, so sometimes it seems like there is a bit of battle to see who can be the biggest diva. Regardless, we have a lot of fun. I love hanging out with Helena in our downtime just to see what kind of crazy eccentric outfit she’ll pull out that day. She’s a character on and off the screen! She is also a really hard worker and a phenomenal actress, and it’s been a pleasure to work alongside her. 
          </p>
          <h4>
            That’s wonderful! Is there anyone on set you have had any problems with?
          </h4>
          <p>
            -Nothing too serious, but one time shortly after we all arrived on set Chriss Pratt patted me on the head. Like a freakin dog. And then proceeded to rub my bald spot. Mind you, I barely know the guy! I smacked his hand right off and some foul words I’m not too proud of were exchanged. I got over it pretty quickly though and he was super apologetic afterwards. He just needed a reminder that I’m almost double his age, even if I’m half his height…
          </p>
          <h4>
            Oh man! That sounds like quite a sight. As we all know, you are an incredibly successful actor, producer, director and screenwriter. You are also a talented singer, but is there anything you wished you could show the world more of?
          </h4>
          <p>
            -You would never guess, but these hips don’t lie young man. I can salsa with the best of em! I’m partly joking but seriously I love to dance. Maybe it’s my low center of gravity, or the overcompensating for my height at highschool dances, but my feet are lighting quick. I used to hold down the dance floor, shakin my little italian booty. It’s quite a privilege to see, if I do say so myself.
          </p>
          <h4>
            Haha I would love to see that! We’re about out of time now so for my last question, I personally would love to know, what did you do before you got into acting?
          </h4>
          <p>
            -I was actually a hairdresser. I know it seems funny now considering that hair, or lack of it,  is one of the things I’m known for, physically speaking. Honestly, I loved it. I trained with my sister, Angie, and I just got to hang around a bunch of beautiful women all day. It was a good time! 
          </p>
          <h4>
            Thank you so much for being on the show! It’s been an absolute pleasure speaking with you. I hope you get that olive oil! 
          </h4>
          <p>
            -Sure man it’s all part of the job. And yeah I texted my assistant while you were fixing your goofy tie and it’s already in my trailer on set.
          </p>
          <h4>
            (chuckles, embarrassed) Err… Right! Thanks so much. Alright and to our audience! Tune in next week for an exclusive interview with Pete Davidson on why he thinks Timothee Chalamet is ugly. This has been 106.8’s Celebrity News!
