        <h2>Basic Plot Synopsis</h2>
        <h3>Written by Andromeda Figueroa and Paolo Octoman</h3>
        <p>
          This is a musical adaptation of the classic cartoon film, Chicken Run which was released in 2000. The film, reset in nineteenth century peak industrial revolution America, is an adventure comedy that takes place in a chicken farm where the group of chickens regularly try to escape farm owner, Mrs. Tweedy, who sends chickens to the slaughter if they don’t consistently lay eggs. However, the chickens learn of their impending death as Mrs.Tweedy assembles a chicken pie-making machine. The chickens then seek the help of an escaped circus rooster for how to escape, and that is by teaching them how to fly.

        <h2>Types of characterisation we will have</h2>
        <h3>Written by Sharon Tulman</h3>
        <p>
          All of our characters will be played by actors that we feel best fit the intended roles for our adaptation. For example, Emily Blunt will play the role of Ginger in the film because she is known to be a strong female lead such as her role in both Sicario (2015) as a federal agent and in Edge of Tomorrow (2014) as a soldier. Another lead actor for the character Rocky will be Chris Pratt. He plays Star Lord in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and would be an excellent candidate for the position because of his similar character traits to Rocky. For our last main character, Ms. Tweedy, we chose Helena Bonham Carter to play this role. We chose Helana for her abilities in playing the roles of powerful women in previously starred films such as the Queen of Hearts in Alice and Wonderland (2010). For these reasons, our adaptation is worth watching in that the characters will be played by star actors who are well fitted for their role.

        <h2>Mise En Scene and any other visual motifs:</h2>
        <h3>Written by Paolo Octoman and Andromeda Figueroa</h3>
        <p>
          The Mise En Scene of the film will be Tweedy's farm which will include the interior and exterior of the chicken coop, Tweedy’s house, the pie machine and the final utopia. The chicken farm visually resembles that of internment camps, several wooden barracks on a plain dirt ground, surrounded by high fencing. Throughout most of the film, there would be heavy color schemes of dark neutral colors, evoking a gritty visual tone of the film.

        <h2>Our ideas on cinematography/music:</h2>
        <h3>Written by Andromeda Figueroa</h3>
        <p>
          The music that is being sung in the film is all original and the background music is from other artists. Some of our ideas for original music is having Ginger’s I want song which is titled “A Field of Grass” and Mrs. Tweedy’s I want song that is titled “Everyone Needs a Tweedy Pie”. Some of our ideas for background music is the Mission Impossible theme song which is set to play at the beginning of the film. Another idea for background music is “Moonlight Sonata” which is set for the betrayal scene towards the end of the film. For cinematography we have created a shot-list that has a short description of what is being filmed and what the framing, angle and perspective of that shot is. An example of this is filming when Ginger gets caught by Mr. Tweedy in the beginning of the film and that shot would be filmed at a medium frame, with a straight angle and the perspective is towards the camera.

        <h2>Trailers/posters/film mags:</h2>
        <h3>Written by Angel Munoz, Edited by Paolo Octoman</h3>
        <p>
          The cast trailer is a compilation of scenes of other notable work from the film’s lead cast. The trailer starts off with a climactic scene from the film to get the viewer engaged and excited, and then some of the main characters are introduced. The fast-paced, upbeat music also helps to grasp the audience’s attention, reflecting the action-adventure genre of the film. For example, the cast trailer begins with the main protagonist Ginger who is played by Emily Blunt, exhibits her lead role in Edge of Tomorrow (2014) which shares character traits similar to Ginger. Parts of popular films like these that showcase certain aspects and characteristics of particular characters are used to represent some of the actors in our chosen film, Chicken Run. These scenes give the audience a better understanding of the character’s personalities and identities by comparing them to popular actors in well-known movies.

        <h2>Resources we will need:</h2>
        <h3>Written by Angel Munoz</h3>
        <p>
          The actors in the film musical adaptation will include members of our group and prop chickens played by voice actors. Costumes will consist of the attire worn by Mrs. Tweedy/other clothes worn by the humans in the film and the small pieces of clothing worn by the chicken characters, including a hat, bandana, scarf, etc.  Some of the props we will use for this film adaptation are chicken costumes, chicken coops, dog costumes/dog heads, bricks, miniature barrels, a chicken shed, posters, prop eggs, etc. The setting will be in an old, rusty farm/chicken coop.

        <h2>Process to be taken:</h2>
        <h3>Written by Dylan Burger</h3>
        <p>
          In order to adapt this film to a modern day musical, the most important aspect needed would be a fitting soundtrack. This will include a myriad of songs fitting to relevant scenes throughout the musical. These songs can include themes pertaining to significant scenes with motion. For example, there is a montage in which the chickens are working out in order to practice flying. In this scene, it would be fitting to draft up a song that could include sounds from said training. This could include either motivational lyrics or incorporation of training objects that could match up with the song itself. It would play out similarly to “I’ll make a man out of you” from Mulan. Another instance of a song would be from the point of view of the villain, Mrs. Tweedy. The song could include beats using the machine that Mrs. Tweedy uses to slaughter the chickens as well as a menacing overall feel to the music.

        <h2>Projected Budget:</h2>
        <h3>Written by Paolo Octoman (Data and analysis gathered by Raymond Sanchez and Ester Sam)</h3>
        <p>
          In order to produce this film, we will need a budget of $5 million (though we estimate that we can raise $75 thousand through crowdfunding based on the film's cult following). The funding would be allocated as follows:

        <h2>How we will advertise the musical:</h2>
        <h3>Written by Dylan Burger</h3>
        <p>
          Due to the fact that this is a musical adaptation remake of a well established film, marketing this musical will be slightly different compared to standalone films. Part of the marketing plan would be pushing towards a tribute of the old film. This aspect is due to the popular reception that the original Chicken Run film has. Utilizing the nostalgia that the original audience has for the film, we can ride that wave in order to gain attention. Not only will the nostalgia from the viewers of the original film attract an audience, younger children will be excited to see this musical. This is due to the abstract nature of the story. The wacky and vibrant characters as well as the fact that they’re chickens is an interesting premise on its own and it will attract a solid viewership from a large variety of ages.

        <h2>Our unique selling point:</h2>
        <h3>Written by Andromeda Figueroa and Sharon Tulman and Paolo Octoman</h3>
        <p>
          Chicken Run (2000)  had 26 nominations including a Golden Globe nominee for Best Motion Picture. The film was such an iconic film and that having this musical adaptation of the film is going to show a newer version of the film that many have grown up watching. Not to mention that being the highest grossing stop motion animation film of all time, at over $224 million, there would be no doubt that this musical adaptation would be a commercial success. With the addition of multiple musical numbers and prime actors who have won numerous awards, our adaptation can be seen as a more unique and up to date version of the film. As it being a musical rather than simply a film with music, it also adds to the creativity and overall  viewing experience. Our soundtrack not only includes borrowed music from well known artists, but we are also showcasing original tracks by our lyricist Molly Hafer for the main characters Ginger, Rocky, and the Tweedys. The songs include a more comedic mood, making our version more bright and entertaining than the original film.
